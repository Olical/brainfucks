This is the JavaScript reference implementation of my brainfuck interpreters. Install dependencies with `npm install` and execute with `./brainfuck.js [file]`.

My initial attempt was very dumb and synchronous, I want this second attempt to use immutable structures and better flow control. It got too stringy, so I'm going to rely on some libraries that make JavaScript slightly more bearable.
